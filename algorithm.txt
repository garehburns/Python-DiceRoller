import the library Random
Make asterisk design
Make intro to show what Program assignment this is
Make another asterisk design


Print statement welcoming the user to the Dice Roller
Create 'choice' variable with an integer input giving the user options for which dice he/she would like to choose from


(TROUBLESHOOTING):  Came back to this issue after I coded all the if statements below
	V	    Had to figure out how to get the program to continue to run after the user was given the random roll
		    Also had to find out what type of variable to create and what while loop could go along with it

Create a while loop to display the categories for the user as long as choice does NOT equal 0
Create an input for the user to select a specific category
Create 'exitToMain' variable set to 'n' before making the second while loop

Create while loop to keep the program running as long as 'exitToMain' is NOT equal to 'y'


Create an if statement that runs if 'choice' variable is equal to 1
	Make 'fourSided' variable equal a random range (imported from the random library) from 1-4
	Print statement that shows what number the random range decided to generate
	
	Create another if statement that tells if 'fourSided' is equal to the lowest number (1)
		Print statement to execute a phrase telling the user that they rolled the minimum roll number
	Create elif statement that tells if 'fourSided' is equal to the highest number (4)
		Print statement to execute a phrase telling the user that they rolled the maximum roll number
	Create an else statement in case they neither rolled a 1 or 4
		Print statement to execute an encouraging message telling the user "Good roll!"


Copy and paste the main if statement from above with the if, elif, and else statements along with it 4 times
Went through the first copy and changed the if statement to elif
Changed it to run if'choice' variable is equal to 2 instead of 1
Changed the 'fourSided' variable to 'sixSided'
Changed randrange from (1,4) to (1,6)
Changed the other variable names that were 'fourSided' to 'sixSided'
Changed the elif statement from seeing if 'sixSided' is equal to 4 to seeing if it was equal to 6


Repeat and make slight changes for the 8-sided dice (choice 3)

Repeat and make slight changed for the 10-sided dice (choice 4)

Repeat and make slight changes for the 20-sided dice (choice 5)


Create an if statement that runs if 'choice' variable is equal to 0
	Executes a print statement that thanks the user for using the dice roller and tells them to play again


(TROUBLESHOOTING):  Forgot about the 'exitToMain' variable from before the while loop so I was having trouble with the program rerolling
	V	    Had to reread through my code and found my mistake

Create 'exitToMain' input (from earlier, before the while loop) to allow the user to decide whether or not he/she wants to exit to the main menu by entering 'Y' or 'y'
(If 'N' or 'n' the program will reroll the same dice until the user decided to exit to the main menu)

(SORT OF TROUBLESHOOTING):
Went back and plugged in modules to define specific parts of my program
Defined mainMenu to print out all the stuff that was needed for my main menu
Defined main with mainMenu and all the if and elif statements inside of it
Created a break after the elif choice == 0

Then I ran main to call for the execution of main module
